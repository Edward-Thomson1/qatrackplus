Administrators Guide
====================


Introduction
-----------------------

The admin guide is intended for use by anyone who will be responsible for
configuring tests and test lists, modifying references & tolerances or managing
users and user permissions.  Typically this would be limited to a small group
of users within the clinic.


Accessing the admin site
------------------------

To access the admin site, log into QATrack+ and then choose the
**Admin** option from the dropdown at the top right hand corner of the
page (where your username is displayed).

A walk through tutorial (with screenshots) on going from a blank
QATrack+ install to a fully configured, performable test list is
available on the [tutorials page](tutorials/tutorials.md).  Reading
through this tutorial is a great way to familiarize yourself with
QATrack+ configuration.


Initial Configuration
---------------------

Before you start defining tests and test lists for the first time it is a good
idea to begin by doing some initial configuration.
