Who is this document for
------------------------

The admin guide is intended for use by anyone who will be responsible for
configuring tests and test lists, modifying references & tolerances or managing
users and user permissions.  Typically this would be limited to a small group
of users within the clinic.


Accessing the admin site
------------------------

To access the admin site, log into QATrack+ and then choose the
**Admin** option from the dropdown at the top right hand corner of the
page (where your username is displayed).

A walk through tutorial (with screenshots) on going from a blank
QATrack+ install to a fully configured, performable test list is
available on the [tutorials page](tutorials/tutorials.md).  Reading
through this tutorial is a great way to familiarize yourself with
QATrack+ configuration.


Initial Configuration
---------------------

Before you start defining tests and test lists for the first time it is a good
idea to begin by doing some initial configuration.

1. [Change the name of your website](change_site_name.md)
1. [Create at least one Unit](units.md)
2. [Define some user groups](auth.md)
3. [Create a couple of test statuses](statuses.md)
4. [Create some test categories](categories.md)
5. [Set up some test frequencies](frequencies.md)
